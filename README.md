# Assignment 3

For `Assignment-3` I have used the **NLTK** corpus
 (news and romance) used for vector semantics models word2vec and Tf-idf. For testing I used **SimLex-999** corpus.

The task aims to suggest a top 10 similar words for a given token.

## Setup

To setup the environment which I used to create this project. Just run 

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Structure

All the essential/useful functions have been added to the **utils folder** and the python script `assignment2.py` and the notebook `assignment2.ipynb` just uses these function to generate results.
